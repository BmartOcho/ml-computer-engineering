# Self-Directed Computer Engineering & Machine Learning Program

## Overview

This repository is a self-directed, project-based Computer Engineering and Machine Learning curriculum designed to replicate—and in many areas exceed—the practical outcomes of a traditional Master’s degree program.

The focus is on **real systems, real constraints, and real deliverables**, not passive coursework. Every concept learned is paired with implementation, evaluation, and documentation.

This program emphasizes:

- Machine Learning foundations and applications
- Signal processing for real-world data
- Embedded and edge systems
- Computer vision and NLP
- Distributed ML systems
- Hardware-aware performance tradeoffs

The ultimate goal is **job-ready competence**, demonstrated through public artifacts, not credentials.

## Program Goals

- Build a deep, working understanding of machine learning and signal processing
- Design and implement embedded and sensor-driven systems
- Develop ML systems that operate under real constraints (latency, noise, memory, power)
- Produce a portfolio that maps directly to real engineering roles
- Eliminate reliance on “black-box” ML usage

---

## Time Commitment & Structure

- **Commitment:** 10–20 hours per week
- **Cadence:** Work is done every day, including weekends
- **Format:** Project-first, artifact-driven learning

Learning without implementation does not count.

Each week must produce:

1. Working code
2. A documented artifact (README, notebook, or report)
3. A clear explanation of decisions, tradeoffs, and failures
